# Meal Journal App

This is a React Native app built with Expo that allows users to track their meals with photos, descriptions, and categories. Users can register and log in, choose a photo from the gallery or take a new one using their phone camera, add a description of the dish, and select a category such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Snacks.

All meal entries can be viewed and edited later, giving users a simple and visual food journaling experience.

### ðŸ”¥ Unique Feature

The app automatically selects the appropriate meal category based on the current time of day on the user's device, making the experience more seamless and intuitive.
